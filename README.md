DESCRIPTION:

The Interactive Quiz Application is designed to allow users to answer multiple-choice questions and receive immediate feedback on their responses. The app dynamically loads questions and tracks the user’s score in real-time. Once the user selects an answer, the application highlights the selected option as either correct or incorrect, and the correct answer is displayed immediately. The app provides a seamless, interactive experience that makes learning fun and engaging. This type of application can be used for educational purposes, exam preparation, or training modules where instant feedback is crucial for learning retention. The application supports multiple questions and automatically navigates through them, showing the final score at the end.

The app is designed to be responsive, visually appealing, and easy to use. It uses a modern gradient-based UI, animated buttons, and clear visual indicators for correct and wrong answers. The implementation ensures that users cannot select multiple answers for the same question, and they can proceed to the next question only after reviewing the feedback. The scoring system provides immediate insight into user performance, motivating learners to improve. Additionally, the application can be easily expanded to include more questions, different categories, or a timer for competitive quizzes.
